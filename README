# Historical Grocery Price Tracker

**Demo Coming Soon**

Grocery Price Tracker is a web application that lets users explore historical grocery prices, add their favorite items to a cart, and compare price trends over time with interactive charts. The backend is powered by Django (with Django REST Framework) and a CSV import utility to ingest historical price data, while the frontend is built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Material UI, and Recharts.

## Features

- **Catalog View**
  - Displays a list of grocery items with their names and the most recent price.
  - Each item shows a placeholder image.
  - Users can add items to their cart.
  
- **Cart View**
  - Lists all selected grocery items.
  - Displays each item's latest price.
  - Calculates the total price for all items in the cart.
  - A "Compare" button toggles a comparison chart.

- **Historical Price Comparison**
  - Compare historical price trends via an interactive line chart.
  - Visualizes price history (from 1995 to 2022) for selected grocery items.

- **Backend API**
  - Django REST Framework exposes endpoints for grocery data.
  - CSV import functionality populates the database with historical price data.
  - Handles edge cases (such as null values) gracefully.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework, SQLite (default)
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Material UI, Recharts
- **Data Import:** Python (with optional Pandas for CSV transformation)
